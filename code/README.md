 This directory contains the scripts used during this project
 
 Most scripts are made to run as an sbatch script:
 ```
 sbatch my_script.sh
 ```
 The *.sh files can either be run as an sbatch or on the command line.  
 The *.txt files are either configuration files or files with instructions to run analysis on a browser.  
 The *.md files contain instructions to run analysis that involve several scripts.
 
 There will be an explanation on the parameters and output of the programs in the Wiki.
