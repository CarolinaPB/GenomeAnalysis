To run Maker2

--> a separate set of control files will need to be generated for each genome annotated with MAKER

cp -v /sw/apps/bioinfo/GeneMark/4.33-es/rackham/gm_key /home/carolpb/GenomeAnalysis/results/6_Maker2

maker -h

maker -CTL
> creates the control files

maker_exe.ctl - with all the paths to different executables used by MAKER on your system.
maker_bopt.ctl - containing settings for BLAST and Exonerate.
maker_opt.ctl - contains all other information for MAKER, including the location of the input genome file.
